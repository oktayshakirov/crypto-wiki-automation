## **Michael Saylor: MicroStrategy Executive Chairman & Bitcoin Advocate**

Michael Saylor (born 1965) is the co-founder and **Executive Chairman** of MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: MSTR), a company globally recognized for its business intelligence software and, more recently, for its pioneering and large-scale adoption of **[Bitcoin](/posts/what-is-bitcoin)** as its primary treasury reserve asset. Saylor has become one of the most prominent and vocal corporate proponents of Bitcoin worldwide, significantly influencing institutional perspectives and strategies related to digital assets.

> "Bitcoin is the apex property of the human race. It's the only asset where you can observe 24x7 liquidity at all times in all places and it reflects the aggregate collective wisdom of the world." – Michael Saylor

## **Early Life, Education, and MicroStrategy Founding**

Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Michael Saylor attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on an Air Force ROTC scholarship. He earned dual degrees in Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Science, Technology, and Society. After a brief stint in consulting, he co-founded MicroStrategy in 1989. The company established itself as a provider of business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services, going public via an IPO in 1998. Saylor also authored "_The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything_" in 2012, showcasing an early interest in transformative technologies.

## **MicroStrategy's Groundbreaking Bitcoin Strategy (2020 Onwards)**

In a move that fundamentally shifted the conversation around corporate finance and digital assets, MicroStrategy, under Saylor's leadership as then-CEO, initiated a large-scale Bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020.

- **The Strategic Pivot:** The company made an initial purchase of $250 million worth of Bitcoin, publicly stating its rationale: concerns about accelerating currency debasement and the long-term value erosion of holding cash reserves. Saylor positioned Bitcoin as a superior **Store of Value** and a rational **Inflation** hedge for corporate treasuries.
- **Continuous Accumulation:** Since the initial purchase, MicroStrategy has pursued an aggressive strategy of continuously acquiring more Bitcoin. The company utilizes cash flow from its software business as well as significant capital raised through debt offerings (like convertible senior notes) and equity sales (via at-the-market programs) to fund these ongoing purchases. As of mid-April 2025, MicroStrategy holds **over 531,000 BTC**, representing the largest Bitcoin treasury of any publicly traded company globally, acquired for an aggregate cost exceeding $35 billion. Real-time tracking of MicroStrategy's holdings is often monitored via resources like **[Saylor Tracker](https://saylortracker.com/)** or the company's investor relations disclosures, including its official **[Bitcoin resources page](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/bitcoin)**.
- **Role Transition (August 2022):** To dedicate more focus to the Bitcoin strategy and related advocacy, Saylor transitioned from the CEO role to **Executive Chairman** of MicroStrategy. Phong Le, previously the company's President, took over as CEO, managing the core software business (recently rebranded under the name 'Strategy' for some operations).

## **Saylor's Advocacy and Market Influence**

Michael Saylor is arguably the most visible corporate advocate for Bitcoin globally.

- **Public Evangelism:** He tirelessly promotes Bitcoin through countless media interviews, keynote speeches at major financial and crypto conferences (including MicroStrategy's own "Bitcoin for Corporations" events), and prolific activity on social media platforms like Twitter (X).
- **Core Arguments:** His advocacy centers on Bitcoin's unique properties: its absolute digital scarcity (capped supply of 21 million coins), its decentralized and robust **[Blockchain](/posts/what-is-blockchain)** network, its potential to function as "digital gold" or digital energy, its role as a global, non-sovereign store of value, and its necessity as a treasury reserve asset for corporations seeking to preserve capital long-term.
- **Institutional Impact:** MicroStrategy's bold public commitment provided a crucial case study and arguably lowered the perceived career risk for other corporate executives and institutional investors considering Bitcoin allocations. Its strategy influenced companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) in their earlier Bitcoin treasury decisions and continues to shape discussions within corporate finance regarding digital assets. MicroStrategy's stock (MSTR) itself has become a popular proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional investment portfolios, particularly before the widespread availability of spot Bitcoin ETFs.

## **Philosophy and Notable Quotes**

Saylor champions a long-term investment horizon for Bitcoin, aligning with the **[HODL](/posts/common-crypto-terms)** ethos prevalent within the Bitcoin community. His public statements often convey strong conviction:

> "If I had to choose between losing everything and having my Bitcoin, or keeping everything and losing my Bitcoin, I’d lose everything and keep my Bitcoin."

> "Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software, offering a global, affordable, simple, and secure savings account to billions of people."

## **Points to Consider / Criticisms**

While Saylor's strategy has been influential, it's also subject to debate and carries risks:

- **Leverage and Volatility:** MicroStrategy has issued billions in debt (primarily convertible notes) to fund Bitcoin purchases. This leveraged approach significantly amplifies the company's exposure to **[Crypto Volatility](/posts/crypto-volatility)**. MSTR's stock price exhibits extremely high correlation with Bitcoin's price movements.
- **Business Model Transformation:** The scale of the Bitcoin holdings has fundamentally shifted MicroStrategy's profile from primarily a software company to what many analysts view as a leveraged Bitcoin investment vehicle. This concentration carries risks distinct from its original operating business.
- **Personal Holdings:** While Saylor has publicly stated he personally owns Bitcoin (disclosing holdings of ~17,732 BTC in late 2020), specific personal wallet addresses are not typically confirmed publicly for security and privacy reasons. Tracking alleged personal wallets is often speculative.
- **Regulatory Environment:** Although MicroStrategy's strategy involves holding Bitcoin directly (allowed for corporations), the overall regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies could still impact Bitcoin's market valuation and perception, thereby affecting MicroStrategy.

## **Conclusion: A Corporate Bitcoin Pioneer**

Michael Saylor, through his leadership role at MicroStrategy, has become a pivotal figure in the narrative of Bitcoin's adoption by the corporate world. His decision to convert MicroStrategy's treasury reserves into Bitcoin starting in 2020 was a groundbreaking move that provided a public blueprint for other institutions. His unwavering, vocal advocacy and MicroStrategy's continued accumulation have cemented his status as a leading Bitcoin proponent. While the leveraged strategy employed by MicroStrategy carries significant risks tied to Bitcoin's volatility, Saylor's actions have undeniably influenced institutional perception and contributed to the legitimization of Bitcoin as a potential macro asset within corporate finance. He remains a central and often debated voice shaping the future discourse around Bitcoin.
