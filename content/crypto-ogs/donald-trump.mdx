## **Donald Trump and Cryptocurrency: Policy Shifts in the Second Term**

Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th President of the United States, has demonstrated a significant evolution in his administration's stance on **Cryptocurrency**. After expressing skepticism during his first term, his 2024 campaign and the initial months of his second term (beginning January 2025) have featured a series of actions and policy signals broadly interpreted as favorable to the digital asset industry, aiming to position the U.S. as a leader in the field while opposing certain governmental controls like a Central Bank Digital Currency.

## **From Skepticism to Campaign Embrace (Pre-2025 Context)**

President Trump's initial public comments on cryptocurrency were largely critical. In a notable 2019 tweet, he stated he was "not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies," describing them as "not money" and based on "thin air."

However, his position shifted markedly during the lead-up to and during the 2024 election cycle. He began actively engaging with the crypto community, criticizing the regulatory approach of the incumbent administration as an "anti-crypto crusade," accepting campaign donations in cryptocurrency, and even launching several personal **[NFT](/posts/are-nfts-dead)** collections. This change was a key theme during his successful **[2024 presidential campaign](/posts/donald-trumps-2024-victory)**, where he promised to foster a more welcoming environment for blockchain innovation in the US.

## **Key Policy Actions & Regulatory Changes (Since January 2025)**

Since taking office for his second term, the Trump administration has implemented several notable policy changes impacting the digital asset sector:

- **Executive Orders Setting Direction:**
  - **"Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology" (Jan 23, 2025):** This foundational EO established a federal policy supportive of "responsible growth" in digital assets. It created the **President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets**, chaired by a newly appointed "Crypto Czar" (David Sacks), tasked with reviewing existing rules and proposing a new regulatory framework by mid-2025. The EO explicitly **prohibited federal agencies from working towards a US CBDC** and promoted US dollar-backed stablecoins. See: **[Central Bank Digital Currencies](/posts/central-bank-digital-currencies)**.
  - **"Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve..." (Mar 6, 2025):** This order formally created a national **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**. Importantly, it is initially capitalized **only using Bitcoin already held by the US government** through asset forfeitures (estimated >200,000 BTC). The order mandates these reserves **are not to be sold**. While Treasury and Commerce are authorized to _explore_ budget-neutral future acquisition strategies, no active government purchasing program was established. A separate **US Digital Asset Stockpile** was created for other forfeited cryptocurrencies.
- **Shift in Regulatory Posture:**
  - **SEC Leadership & Focus:** Key leadership changes occurred at the **SEC**. Mark Uyeda became Acting Chair, Paul Atkins (viewed as crypto-friendly) was nominated for permanent Chair, and Commissioner Hester Peirce now leads a "Crypto 2.0" task force aimed at providing regulatory clarity rather than relying solely on enforcement. This shift was accompanied by the **rescission of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121** (which had imposed burdensome custody accounting rules on banks) and the **dropping or pausing of several high-profile SEC enforcement actions** against crypto firms in early 2025. The SEC staff also issued statements clarifying that assets like meme coins would not be considered securities.
  - **Easing Banking Restrictions:** Both the OCC and FDIC issued guidance (March 2025) **rescinding previous directives** that had effectively discouraged banks from providing custody or stablecoin reserve services, signaling an end to practices perceived as "Operation Chokepoint 2.0."
  - **DOJ Enforcement Shift:** The Department of Justice **disbanded its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET)** in April 2025, with new guidance directing prosecutors to focus on the illicit _use_ of crypto (e.g., by criminal organizations, terrorists) rather than pursuing regulatory violations by the platforms themselves.

## **Supporting US Bitcoin Mining**

President Trump has consistently voiced support for **[Bitcoin](/posts/what-is-bitcoin)** **[Mining](/posts/is-bitcoin-mining-still-profitable)** within the United States, framing it as beneficial for national energy infrastructure and energy dominance. While specific federal incentives proposed during the campaign might require legislative action, the overall administrative tone has been interpreted as encouraging for the domestic mining sector. Discussions around the environmental impact of **[Proof-of-Work](/posts/what-is-proof-of-work)** mining continue. See: **[Crypto and the Environment](/posts/crypto-and-the-environment)**.

## **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk**

An Executive Order in January 2025 established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with reducing federal spending and bureaucracy, essentially repurposing the existing US Digital Service.

- **[Elon Musk](/crypto-ogs/elon-musk)** was appointed as a senior advisor, heavily involved in the initiative's direction, although his precise title and authority relative to the official acting administrator remain subjects of public discussion.
- While initial reports suggested **[Blockchain](/posts/what-is-blockchain)** technology might be employed by DOGE for enhanced transparency or efficiency, concrete large-scale implementations were not widely confirmed as of early 2025.

## **Cryptocurrency ETFs**

The landmark approvals for Spot Bitcoin **ETF**s (January 2024) and Spot Ether ETFs (May 2024) occurred before President Trump's second term. However, the subsequent shift towards a more crypto-friendly leadership at the SEC is widely perceived by industry observers as potentially improving the prospects for future ETF applications based on other **[Altcoins](/posts/what-are-altcoins)** or incorporating features like staking rewards, although each application still undergoes a rigorous review process.

## **Impact, Criticisms, and Outlook**

The administration's early pro-crypto policy actions have been largely welcomed by the US digital asset industry, providing sought-after signals of regulatory easing and support for domestic growth. However:

- **Implementation Details Matter:** The ultimate impact hinges on the specific regulations proposed by the Working Group, potential Congressional legislation (like the FIT21 bill), and how agencies interpret and enforce rules going forward.
- **Balancing Innovation and Protection:** Critics raise concerns that reducing regulatory oversight too much could undermine investor protection and potentially facilitate illicit finance, despite the administration's stated focus on "responsible" growth.
- **Market **[Volatility](/posts/crypto-volatility)**:** Government policies and even rhetoric regarding crypto can significantly influence market prices. The management and potential future growth of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could also become a market factor.
- **Policy Consistency:** The notable shift from Trump's previous criticisms draws attention and raises questions for some regarding the long-term durability of the current pro-crypto stance.

## **Conclusion: A New Era for US Crypto Policy**

Donald Trump's second term presidency initiated a marked pivot in the United States' approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Through executive orders establishing a supportive policy framework, creating a national Bitcoin reserve from existing holdings, opposing a CBDC, and installing new leadership at key regulatory agencies like the SEC, the administration has signaled a clear intent to foster the digital asset industry's growth domestically. While this shift away from "regulation by enforcement" has energized the crypto sector, the specific contours of the new regulatory landscape are still taking shape, and the long-term economic and societal impacts of these policies remain a critical focus for the years ahead.
