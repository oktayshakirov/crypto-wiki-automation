I’m ready to write a narrative-driven Crypto OG biography, but I’m missing the populated data needed to meet your requirements. Please provide:

- Name: Full name (and common alias/handle) of the Crypto OG
- INTERNAL LINK DATABASES (exact format: key|slug|title)
  - CRYPTO_OGS: …
  - POSTS: …
  - EXCHANGES: …
  - TOOLS: …
- Guidelines text: The full “GUIDELINES” block you want applied

Optional but helpful:
- Must-include milestones (dates, funding amounts, launches)
- Any controversies to address for balance
- Preferred angle (e.g., builder, trader, policy, research)

Once I have these, I’ll craft the biography with 8–15 natural internal links and conclude with a verified social JSON object.
